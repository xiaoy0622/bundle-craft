## App Details (500 chars max)

BundleCraft simplifies product bundling for Shopify merchants. Create fixed bundles by selecting products, setting a discount, and publishing — all from a single form. Bundles are created as native Shopify products with cart transform functions that automatically expand bundle items at checkout. A theme block shows customers when a product is part of a bundle, encouraging higher-value purchases. Merchants can configure discount types (percentage, fixed amount, or fixed price) and customize the storefront display through the theme editor.
